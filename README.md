# HTML-Basics
Hey! 👋
This is my personal repository where I’m learning and practicing HTML (HyperText Markup Language) — the backbone of web development. I'm using this space to organize my notes, examples, and mini projects as I build my skills step by step.

📁 What’s Inside
HTML Basics – Tags, elements, attributes

Text & Headings – Paragraphs, headings, lists, formatting

Links & Images – Anchor tags, image embedding

Forms – Inputs, buttons, labels, form structure

Tables – Rows, columns, headers

Semantic HTML – Proper structure using semantic elements

Mini Projects – Simple pages and exercises for practice

🎯 Why I Made This
I started this repo to:

Practice and improve my HTML skills

Keep track of everything I learn

Share my progress and maybe help others who are also learning
